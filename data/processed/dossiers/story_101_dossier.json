Then a low door was\nopened before him, and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead\nhe entered a small room cut out of the rock. The cell was clean, though\nempty, and dry, though situated at an immeasurable distance under the\nearth. A bed of dried grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one\ncorner.
