Not that they had anything to fear personally from these\nanimals, but the malicious beasts gnawed the halters, so that the\nhorses could escape.\n\nA few paces from the rancho, a hole was dug which served as a kitchen\nand contained half-cooled embers. Within, there was a bench, a bed of\nox-hide, a saucepan, a spit, and a pot for boiling mat\u00e9. The mat\u00e9 is\na drink very much in use in South America.
