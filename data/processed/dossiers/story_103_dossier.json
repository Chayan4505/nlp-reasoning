Probably the sea, during\nviolent equinoctial storms, had beaten against this fragile barrier,\nand thus caused the fall of the upper portions of the mass.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions entered this opening, and reached the\nsummit of the cliffs by a very steep ascent. Robert climbed an abrupt\ndeclivity with the agility of a cat, and arrived first at the top,\nto the great chagrin of Paganel, who was quite mortified at seeing\nhimself outstripped by a mere lad of twelve. However, he distanced the\npeaceable major; but that worthy was utterly indifferent to his defeat.\n\nThe little party surveyed the plain that stretched out beneath them.\nIt was a vast, uncultivated tract, covered with bushes and brushwood,\nand was compared by Glenarvan to the glens of the Scottish lowlands,\nand by Paganel to the barren lands of Brittany.

As we have seen,\ntherefore, he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a\nrecognition, but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his\npresent forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity.\n\nIn vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which\nassailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep.
