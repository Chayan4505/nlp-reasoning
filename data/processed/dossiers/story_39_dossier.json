The sailors\nsprang into the windward rattlings, and with difficulty accomplished\ntheir task. Captain Mangles wished to keep on as much sail as possible,\nto support the yacht and moderate her rolling. After these precautions\nhad been taken, he told the mate and the boatswain to prepare for the\nassault of the tempest, which could not be long in breaking forth.\nStill, like an officer at the storming of a breach, he did not leave\nthe point of observation, but from the upper deck endeavored to draw\nfrom the stormy sky its secrets.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ADDED CALAMITY.]\n\nIt was now one o'clock in the morning. Lady Helena and Miss Grant,\naroused by the unusual bustle, ventured to come on deck.
