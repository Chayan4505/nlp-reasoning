While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting.\n\nHe snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn.\n\n\"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers.\n\nJust then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder.
