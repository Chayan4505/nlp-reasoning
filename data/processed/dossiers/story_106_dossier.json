I have met him several times at Florence,\nBologna and Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his\narrival in Paris. The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort\nof claim on one; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention\nwhich you once paid them by chance, as though the civilities of a\npassing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the\nman in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your\njourney. This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of\nParis, which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire,\nwhen he was on his way to Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he\nwill confide his son to my care, I will promise to watch over him, I\nshall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him, and then\nI shall have done my part.\u201d\n\n\u201cC",

At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct\nsound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with\nthe clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and\nbuzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the\nbridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension\nquelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most\ndeathlike stillness prevailed.\n\nThe sounds drew nearer.
