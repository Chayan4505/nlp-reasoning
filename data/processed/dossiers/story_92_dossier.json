I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier,\nthat the contract is to be signed this evening.\u201d\n\nMorrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the\ncontract was to be signed that evening. Then he went to call on Monte\nCristo and heard still more. Franz had been to announce the ceremony,\nand Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her\nnot inviting him; the death of M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran and the dangerous\nillness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she\nwould regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every\nhappiness.\n\nThe day before Franz had been presented to Ma",

When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of\nFranz, the pupil of M. Noirtier\u2019s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids\ntrembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an\nindividual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame\nde Villefort and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred\nwhich had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d\u2019\u00c9pinay,\nwell understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had\nproduced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed\nthe narrative begun by his wife.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are aware that Valentine is about to enter her\nnineteenth year, which renders it important that she should lose no\ntime in forming a suitable alliance.
