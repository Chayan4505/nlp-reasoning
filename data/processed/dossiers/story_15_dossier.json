The\ntime of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a\ngrand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were\ninvited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked\npermission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be\npresent amongst the servants of the house. This was granted.
