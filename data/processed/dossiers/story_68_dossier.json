Then, shaking his head as a man who is mistaken, he returned\nto his companions, took an armful of dead wood and threw it on the\nhalf-extinct fire, whose flames revived. His face, brightly illumined\nby the blaze, betrayed no more anxiety, and, after gazing at the first\nglimmers of dawn that tinged the horizon, he stretched himself beside\nthe fire to warm his cold limbs.\n\n\"All right!\" said Wilson.\n\nThe captain made a sign to Glenarvan to continue his descent.
