Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes.\n\nAfter some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris.
