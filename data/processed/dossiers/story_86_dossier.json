He had started the previous evening, and had only\nreturned an hour since. He was charming. Whether he kept a watch over\nhimself, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords\nthat in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight like\neverybody else.\n\nThe man was an enigma to Franz. The count must feel sure that Franz\nrecognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating\nany previous acquaintance between them. On his side, however great\nFranz\u2019s desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of\nbeing disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with\nkindness prevented him from mentioning it.\n\nThe count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at\nthe Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let.

At the end of twelve days, after having made a\nsplendid dinner, he reckoned his accounts, and found that he had only\n50,000 francs left. Then a strange reaction took place; he who had just\nabandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left,\nand sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of\nprivation\u2014he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of\nmadness.\n\nHe, who for so long a time had forgotten God, began to think that\nmiracles were possible\u2014that the accursed cavern might be discovered by\nthe officers of the Papal States, who would release him; that then he\nwould have 50,000 remaining, which would be sufficient to save him from\nstarvation; and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to\nhim, and as he prayed he wept.
