He invited them\nto visit his house, and sit for once at his table. Glenarvan and his\ncompanions cordially accepted the invitation, and Robert and Mary\nwere not a little desirous to see those haunts where their father had\ndoubtless at times bewailed his fate. A boat was manned, and the whole\nparty soon disembarked on the shores of the island.\n\nA few hours sufficed to traverse Captain Grant's domain. It was in\nreality the summit of a submarine mountain, covered with basaltic rocks\nand volcanic fragments. When the shipwrecked seamen of the Britannia\ntook refuge here, the hand of man began to control the development of\nnature's resources, and in two years and a half the captain and his\ncompanions had completely metamorphosed their island home.\n\nThe visitors at last reached the house, shaded by verdant gum-trees,\n",

The preparations were begun that\nvery day, and it was resolved to keep the expedition secret, in order\nnot to alarm the Indians. The 14th of October was fixed for the day of\ndeparture.\n\nWhen they came to choose the sailors who were to go, they all offered\ntheir services, and Glenarvan was forced to make a choice. He preferred\nto have them draw lots, that he might not mortify such brave men. This\nwas accordingly done; and the mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful\nfellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones.\n\nLord Glenarvan had displayed great energy in his preparations, for he\nwished to be ready at the day appointed; and he was. Captain Mangles\nlikewise supplied his ship with coal, that he might put to sea at any\nmoment. He wished to gain the Argentine shore before the travelers.\nHence there was a real rivalry between Glenarvan and the captain, which\nwas of advantage to both.\n\nAt last, on the 14th of October, at the tim",
