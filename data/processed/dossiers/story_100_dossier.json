All was dark; one solitary,\nfeeble light was burning in the porter\u2019s lodge, about forty paces\ndistant from the house, as Baptistin had said.\n\nMonte Cristo leaned against a tree, and with that scrutinizing glance\nwhich was so rarely deceived, looked up and down the avenue, examined\nthe passers-by, and carefully looked down the neighboring streets, to\nsee that no one was concealed. Ten minutes passed thus, and he was\nconvinced that no one was watching him. He hastened to the side-door\nwith Ali, entered hurriedly, and by the servants\u2019 staircase, of which\nhe had the key, gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a\nsingle curtain, without even the porter having the slightest suspicion\nthat the house, which he supposed empty, contained its chief occupant.\n\nArrived in his bedroom, the count motioned to Ali to stop; then he\npassed into the dressing-room, which he examined.
