When the chill of the\nnight had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the\nvilla were closed on them for the _festa_ in-doors, he took Teresa\nquite away, and as he left her at her home, he said:\n\n\u201c\u2018Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young\nCountess of San-Felice?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I thought,\u2019 replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her\nnature, \u2018that I would give half my life for a costume such as she\nwore.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And what said your cavalier to you?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018He said it only dep",
