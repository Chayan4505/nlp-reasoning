Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother.

The idea of sailing to\nthe rescue of Captain Grant had already taken possession of him when\nhe saw his petition rejected at London; but he could not have thought\nof separating from her. Yet, since she desired to go herself, all\nhesitation was at an end. The servants of the castle had received her\nproposal with cries of joy; the safety of their brother Scots was at\nstake, and Lord Glenarvan joined heartily in the hurrahs that greeted\nthe lady of Luss.\n\nThe scheme once resolved upon, there was not an hour to lose. That\nvery day Lord Glenarvan sent to Captain Mangles orders to bring the\nDuncan to Glasgow, and make every preparation for a voyage to the South\nSeas, which might become one of circumnavigation.
