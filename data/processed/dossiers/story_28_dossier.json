How could she regain\nher prescribed course? How far were they from Cape Bernouilli? Such\nwere the first questions addressed to the captain, who at once took\nhis bearings and noted his observations on the map. The Duncan had\nnot deviated very far from her route. She was at Cape Catastrophe, on\nthe southern coast of Australia, not three hundred miles from Cape\nBernouilli.\n\nBut could the Duncan's injuries be repaired? This was the question to\ndecide. The captain wished to know the extent of the damage. It was\ndiscovered, by diving, that a flange of the screw was bent and came\nin contact with the stern-post. Hence it was impossible for the screw\nto rotate.
