When\nthe patron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and\nevery sail full with the breeze. They were making nearly ten knots an\nhour. The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon.

They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the\nflat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo\nreddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky.

The sea was so high that to save anything was impossible,\nand all the crew perished except my two sailors, Bob Learce and Joe\nBell, and myself; and we succeeded in reaching the coast after many\nstruggles. The land that we thus reached was only a desert island, two\nmiles wide and five long, with a few trees in the interior, some meadow\nland, and a spring of fresh water that, fortunately, has never ceased\nto flow. Alone with my two sailors, in this quarter of the globe, I did\nnot despair, but, placing my confidence in God, engaged in a resolute\nstruggle. Bob and Joe, my companions and friends in misfortune,\nenergetically aided my efforts.
