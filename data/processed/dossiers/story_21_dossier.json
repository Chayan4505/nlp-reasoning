Although he\ncommanded only a pleasure yacht, he was ranked among the ablest of\nthe Glasgow captains. He was thirty years of age, with rather rough\nfeatures, indicating courage and kindness. When a child, the Glenarvan\nfamily had taken him under their care, and made him an excellent\nseaman. He had often given proofs of skill, energy, and coolness during\nhis long voyages, and when Lord Glenarvan offered him the command of\nthe Duncan, he accepted it with pride and pleasure, for he loved the\nlord of Malcolm Castle as a brother, and until then had vainly sought\nan opportunity to devote himself to his service.\n\nThe mate, Tom Austin, was an old sailor worthy of all confidence; and\nthe crew of the Duncan was composed of twenty-five men, including\nthe captain and mate. They all belonged to the county of Dumbarton,\nwere all tried seamen, sons ",
