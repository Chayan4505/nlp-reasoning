The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus.
