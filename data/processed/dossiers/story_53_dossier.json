He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim.
