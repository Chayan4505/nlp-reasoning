There were not lacking, however, evidences of\nwhat we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with\nthe indolent, careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in\na gilded cage. By means of the two windows looking into the street,\nAlbert could see all that passed; the sight of what is going on is\nnecessary to young men, who always want to see the world traverse their\nhorizon, even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare. Then,\nshould anything appear to merit a more minute examination, Albert de\nMorcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate,\nsimilar to that close to the _concierge\u2019s_ door, and which merits a\nparticular description.\n\nIt was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since\nthe house was built, so entirely was it c",

The only\ndifference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated\nby these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the\nequality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the\nguillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.\nObserve,\u201d said Villefort, smiling, \u201cI do not mean to deny that both\nthese men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th ",
