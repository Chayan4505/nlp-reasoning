Dant\u00e8s dived again, and\nremained a long time beneath the water. This was an easy feat to him,\nfor he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the\nlighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously\ndeclared to be the best swimmer in the port. When he came up again the\nlight had disappeared.\n\nHe must now get his bearings. Ratonneau and Pom\u00e8gue are the nearest\nislands of all those that surround the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, but Ratonneau and\nPom\u00e8gue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume.
