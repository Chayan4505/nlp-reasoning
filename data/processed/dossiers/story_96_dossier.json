We\nhave all wished for this interview, and I trust it will convince you\nhow ill-formed are your objections to Valentine\u2019s marriage.\u201d\n\nNoirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort\u2019s blood run cold.\nHe motioned to Valentine to approach. In a moment, thanks to her habit\nof conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a\nkey. Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the\nwindows.
